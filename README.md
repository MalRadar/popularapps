# popularapps

We are happy to share our app popularity dataset. Our dataset is available on Zenodo (due to the data size limitation of Github).

The dataset includes two kinds of files:

(1) Ranking list
This type of files start with "ranking_". They record the chart of popular apps in each market for a year, stored separately by region.

(2) App meta-data
This type of files start with "info_". They record the meta-data for each popular app that is included in the dataset, stored by geographical groups.
